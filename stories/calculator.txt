Calculator Story:

Implement Calculator and Calculator factory to allow for different configurations to be specified
for each Calculator. 
This feature allows for different material calculators to use different conversions , etc. 

For now only quantities defined in terms of units known to the 
Calculator will be considered compatible. - I am not sure this is true with my Java version. 
I think it is more like : if they created by the same Calculator, then and only then they are compatible.
