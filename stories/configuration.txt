Configuration Story:

Implement configuration mechanism to accommodate following configuration requirements:
	1.Be able to load units of measure and dependent units.
		Example: Base unit for length is millimeter (mm) . Meter  (m) is dependent unit, or derived unit.
				 I like derived term better.
	2.Be able to load unit conversions – ‘How to get from one unit to an other’. 
		Example: For a given material conversion from length unit (m) to weight unit (lb) 
				 is as following: 1m = 2.5lb, 1PA = 6894.757 lb/sq.in
	3.Be able to load unit substitutions. Some units, or in fact complex units based on combination of 
	  other units can be substituted with other units.
		Example:  1 sq. in = in * in, etc.

Completion test: All existing configurations from the Java project can be converted and loaded.
