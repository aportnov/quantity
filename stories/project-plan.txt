Project Plan:

I want to convert (well,if I can think of something maybe extend it to) my existing quantity manager framework into Ruby.

Minimum completion test: All my Java based test calculations should be working.

Full completion: 
1.Minimum is satisfied.
2.Ruby style is incorporated.
3.Based on my Ruby knowledge code is re-factored and clean. (No smell!!!)
4.Figure out RDoc.
5.Consider creating gem lib.
